                    <h3>Nature Assistant Information</h3>
                    <p>Assistant has been offline since roughly August 2022. This was an attempt to save power costs - seeing as though it was rarely used at the time. Today, we're happy to announce that Nature Assistant is returning some time between December 25th and January 4th as a result of acquiring a new, permanent low-power server for Nature Assistant and any other projects (whether they be public or private) we wish to work on.<br><br>Don't worry, everything is exactly how it was when we turned Assistant off for the final time. We have only worked on some quality of life changes and bug fixes; one of the more notable ones being the revival of ASDA radio. We can't wait for you to begin using Assistant ready for the new year.</p>
