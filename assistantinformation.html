<h1>Assistant Information</h1>
  
<p>Assistant has been offline since roughly August 2022. This was an attempt to save power costs - seeing as though it was rarely used.<br>We're happy to announce that Nature Assistant is returning some time between December 25th and January 4th as a result of acquiring a new, permanent low-power server for Nature Assistant and any other projects I wish to work on.<br><br>Don't worry, everything is exactly how it was when it shutdown. No secret changes, no added/lost features.</p>
