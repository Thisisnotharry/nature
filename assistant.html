                    <p>Nature Assistant has been offline since roughly mid-August 2022. We did this seeing as though Nature was starting to become quite inactive, therefore the bot was no longer needed, as it was eating network bandwith and was contributing to power costs, as it was essentially just an idiling laptop plugged into the wall 24/7.<br><br>Today, we're happy to announce that Nature Assistant is finally returning! We're making the switch some time between December 25th and January 4th to a new, permanent low-power server for Nature Assistant and any other future projects.<br><br>Don't worry, everything is exactly how it was when we turned Assistant off for the final time. We have only worked on some quality of life changes and bug fixes; one of the more notable ones being the revival of ASDA radio.<br><br>We can't wait for you to begin using Assistant ready for the new year.</p>
